# **Python Programming Assignments**

This project serves as a **common location for all assignments** generated via the discover app for programming.

As **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is the underlying theme, every assignment will have a **corresponding test** that must pass for the assignment to be considered complete.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project Structure**

```
python-programming-assignments/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                         # Source code directory for assignments
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                       # Unit tests for assignments
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt             # Python dependencies 
â””â”€â”€ README.md                    # This file
```

## âœ… **Steps to Complete Assignments**

1. **Run the test file** copied as part of the assignment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m unittest tests/<test-file-name>
   ```

   > ðŸ’¡ On the first run, all tests will fail â€” this is expected.

2. **Modify the assignment files** under `src/` to implement your solution.

3. **Repeat steps 1 & 2** until all tests pass.
